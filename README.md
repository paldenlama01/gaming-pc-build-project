Custom gaming PC build and benchmark documentation (Ryzen 5 5600X + RTX 3060)
# High-Performance Gaming PC Build

## Overview
This project documents the build, configuration, and testing of a custom gaming PC optimized for strong 1080p and 1440p performance. The system was assembled, benchmarked, and tuned for thermal efficiency, stability, and driver compatibility.

## System Specifications
| Component | Model / Description |
|------------|--------------------|
| **CPU** | AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 3.7 GHz 6-Core Processor |
| **CPU Cooler** | Arctic Freezer 34 eSports Duo |
| **Motherboard** | Gigabyte B550M DS3H Micro ATX AM4 |
| **Memory** | 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3600 CL16 |
| **Storage** | Samsung 2 TB M.2 NVMe Internal SSD |
| **GPU** | Zotac GeForce RTX 3060 Twin Edge OC 12 GB |
| **Case** | Corsair iCUE 220T RGB Airflow Mid-Tower |
| **Power Supply** | 650 W 80+ Bronze Certified Fully Modular ATX |
| **Operating System** | Windows 11 Pro 64-bit |

## Benchmarks
| Tool | Result | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Cinebench R23 (Multi-Core)** | 9,740 pts | Ryzen 5 5600X with Arctic Freezer 34 eSports Duo |
| **Cinebench R23 (Single-Core)** | 1,443 pts | Within expected range for 5600X |
| **3DMark Solar Bay Extreme (DX12)** | 8,236 (57.6 FPS) | Stable performance for RTX 3060 |
| **CrystalDiskMark** | 3,538 MB/s Read, 1,654 MB/s Write | Consistent NVMe speed under load |


## Troubleshooting Log
- **Audio Issue:** No sound detected → installed Realtek driver from Gigabyte → sound restored.
- **Motherboard Failure:** System in boot loop → diagnosed faulty board after hardware tests → replaced motherboard → system stable.
